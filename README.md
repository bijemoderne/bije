Smart Water Management System
Project Overview
The Smart Water Management System is designed to help users monitor and manage their daily water consumption. The system allows users to track water usage, set consumption limits, and automatically shut off the water supply when the balance reaches zero or exceeds a preset limit.

This project involves the simulation of a prototype using an ESP32 microcontroller, with plans to integrate a flow sensor, keypad, LCD display, and LED indicators for real-world applications.

Features
Remote Monitoring: Users can track real-time water consumption and balance via an online platform.
Automated Valve Control: The system automatically closes the valve if the balance is depleted or a daily limit is exceeded.
Edge Processing: Local decision-making without reliance on an internet connection.
Prototype Simulation: The system is initially tested using the Wokwi Simulator, with plans to upgrade to Proteus for enhanced features.
Simulation Setup
Using Wokwi Simulator (Initial Stage)
Three houses connected to a single ESP32 microcontroller.
Three buttons to decrease balance (representing water usage).
Three buttons to increase balance (representing top-ups).
Two LEDs:
Red LED → Balance = 0 (Valve Closed).
Green LED → Balance > 0 (Valve Open).
A monitoring platform displays real-time water consumption and user balances.
Using Proteus Simulator (Enhanced Stage)
Keypad for entering balance top-ups.
Flow Sensor to measure water usage and adjust balance automatically.
LCD Display for real-time balance monitoring.
LED Indicators:
Red LED → Balance = 0 (Valve Closed).
Green LED → Balance > 0 (Valve Open).
Deployment
Database: Uses Google Cloud for data storage.
GitHub Page: The project will be deployed on GitHub, allowing online monitoring of three users.
Future Improvements
To make the solution more realistic for community deployment, the following enhancements are required:

Hardware Improvements
Smart Water Meters for accurate consumption tracking.
Automated Valves for physical water shut-off.
Solar Power Backup for sustainable operations.
Software Enhancements
Mobile Application for remote monitoring and control.
AI-Based Predictions for water usage trends.
Multi-User Access Control for shared household management.
Platform Enhancements
Cloud Integration: To support real-time analytics and reporting.
Secure Payment Gateway: For balance top-ups and automatic billing.
IoT Expansion: Integration with smart home automation systems.
